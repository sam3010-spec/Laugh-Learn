This project is a fun and interactive web app built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript that generates a random joke and a fun fact every time the user clicks a button. It fetches data from two public APIs — the Official Joke API for jokes and the Useless Facts API for random facts — and displays the results dynamically on the page. The layout is styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and responsive design. While the current version focuses on functionality without background images, it’s designed to be easily extendable with features like dynamic background images, category filtering, or even saving favorites. This project is great for beginners looking to practice API integration, DOM manipulation, and using utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind.
